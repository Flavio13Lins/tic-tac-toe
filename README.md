# tic-tac-toe

Simple game, but impossible to win.

This is a project to put into practice some of my abilities and training while having fun. The main idea here is to recognize the best pattern in a tic-tac-toe game. Making it impossible to win. I mapped the player's possible moves, finding the solution with reflect or rotations functions to the table if necessary.
